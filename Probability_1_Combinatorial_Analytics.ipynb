    "- In others, however, a more formal approach can help derive insights more quickly. This approach is known as combinatorial analysis, where one determines the number of different states that are possible from the initial conditions. \n",
    "For example, given a single coin, there are only two possible states when flipping the coin: **heads** (H) or **tails** (T). With more coins, the space of possible events grows quickly, and if multiple coins are used, determining the possible end states becomes a much more complex problem. \n",

The difference between these two concepts is that with permutations the order of the values is important, for example, when entering the values for a security code or a telephone number, while for combinations the order is not important, such as selecting lottery numbers or when purchasing items that are used to create a food item. We will walk through each of these cases in more detail."

Note that we cannot select more than three numbers from this input set without replacement. We can express this mathematically as $ 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$, which is used so often that a shorthand notation has been developed called **factorial**, which we represent by using the exclamation mark ($!$). Thus, in our specific case, we have $ 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 3!$, or in general $n!$ for an input set that has $n$ objects. \n",

In this case, we have four ways to select the first number, and three ways to select the second number, or $4 \\times 3$. Or, alternatively, we had to remove the last two multiplications, which we can do by writing out the full multiplication, as was the case for permutations with replacement, and dividing out by the number of ways that we aren't interested in counting, which in this case would be $2 \\times 1$.
