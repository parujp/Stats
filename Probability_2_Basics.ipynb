    "In some processes, several outcomes are possible. When the process is repeated a large no of times, each outcome occurs with a characteristic relative frequency or  probability. If a particular outcome happens more often than another outcome, we say it is more probable\n",

    "The concept of Probability arises in 2 contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In actual repeated experiments where you estimate the probability of a particular outcome\n",
    "- In idealized conceptions of a repeated process ( unbiased die) the expected probability or expected relative probabilities are calculated\n",

    "## Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "One standard approach to estimating probability is to define the probability of an event by the _frequency_ of its occurrence. Thus, for example, we expect that the probability a fair coin comes up heads is 0.5. Formally, this is computed as the number of successes divided by the number of attempts. In general, in the absence of outside information, we follow the [principle of indifference][wpi] and choose uniform probabilities for potential events. Thus we expect:\n",
