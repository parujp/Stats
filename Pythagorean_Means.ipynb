    "When datasets have a multiplicative or exponential relationship (geometric series) to find the geometric mean we multiply rather than add all the numbers. Then to rescale the product back down to the range of the dataset, we have to take the root, rather than simply dividing. This is generally known as the nth root, where n is the size of the dataset.\n",

This can be a problem if we actually want to interpret the results relative to some scale that is meaningful to us, such as the original 5 or 100-point systems.

    "- There are downsides: meaningful scales & units can be lost when applying the geometric mean, and its insensitivity to outliers can obscure large values that may be consequential. Further, it can produce results at odds with the arithmetic mean on values transformed to a single scale.\n"

    "\n",
    "Whereas the arithmetic mean requires addition & the geometric mean employs multiplication, the harmonic mean utilizes reciprocals.\n",

    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "(Note: due to the fact that 0 has no reciprocal (nothing can be multiplied by 0 to = 1), the harmonic mean also cannot handle datasets containing 0’s, similar to the geometric mean.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Real world applications of HM\n",
    "\n",
    "-  the harmonic mean helps us find multiplicative / divisory relationships between fractions without worrying over common denominators.\n",
    "- the harmonic mean naturally accommodates another layer of multiplication / division over the geometric mean. Thus it is helpful when dealing with datasets of rates or ratios (i.e. fractions) over different lengths or periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg:\n",
    "Consider a trip to the grocery store & back:\n",
    "- On the way there you drove 30 mph the entire way\n",
    "- On the way back traffic was crawling, & you drove 10 mph the entire way\n",
    "- You took the same route, & covered the same amount of ground (5 miles) each way.\n",
    "What was your average speed across this entire trip’s duration?\n",
    "\n",
    "Harmonic mean of 30 and 10 = ...\n",
    "Arithmetic mean of reciprocals = 1/30 + 1/10 = 4/30 ÷ 2 = 4/60 = 1/15\n",
    "Reciprocal of arithmetic mean = 1 ÷ 1/15 = 15/1 = 15\n",
    "\n",
    "Our true average rate of travel, automagically adjusted for time spent traveling in each direction = 15 mph!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This only works because the total distance travelled was the same each way. If it was different, we’d have to use a weighted harmonic mean, or another weighted arithmetic mean ( For the arithmetic mean we’d again weight by time spent traveling at each speed, while for the harmonic mean we’d weight by distance travelled (because it already accounts for the proportions of time implicit in the rates, by taking their reciprocals).\n",
    "- Much of the trickiness & spookiness of Pythagorean Means comes down to the nature of ratios & which side of the ratio we’re more interested in. For instance, the arithmetic mean is always expressed in terms of the denominator. In the case of rate of travel, the ratio is miles-per-hour, so the arithmetic mean gives us a result in terms of its (somewhat hidden) denominator, hours: (30m / 1hr)+(10m / 1hr) ÷ 2 = 20m/1hr = 20 mph. This would be accurate if we spent an equal amount of time traveling in each direction, which we know is false. The harmonic mean instead flips these ratios by taking their reciprocals, putting our actual numbers of interest in the denominator, then takes the arithmetic mean, flips it again, & gives us the answer we’re looking for in terms of average speed, proportionate to the time spent at that speed.\n",
    "- The reason the geometric mean worked for our compound interest example above is that the rates were accruing over equivalent periods: one year each. If the periods varied, i.e. different lengths of time spent accruing interest at each rate, we’d have to again use weights of some sort.\n",
    "- While the geometric mean handles multiplicative relationships such as rates applied to a principal investment & ratios on different scoring scales, the harmonic mean takes this one step further, easily accommodating another layer of multiplicative / divisory relationships such as varying periods or lengths, via the magic of reciprocals.\n",
    "- Due to their respective equations: the harmonic mean is always smaller than the geometric mean, which is always smaller than the arithmetic mean.\n",
    "- harmonic mean ≤ geometric mean ≤ arithmetic mean"
